# Data Directory

This directory is where the Excel file should be placed:

- `Heat_pump_deployment_quarterly_statistics_United_Kingdom_2025_Q2.xlsx`

The file should contain:
- **Table 1.1**: Quarterly Heat Pump installations by government scheme
- **Table 1.2**: Quarterly Heat Pump installations by Heat Pump type

Once the file is added, the data parsing functionality can be implemented to replace the current placeholder charts with real data.
